# ðŸ“§ Spam Detector

A simple machine-learning project that classifies messages (SMS / email) as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
This project includes preprocessing, model training (Naive Bayes), evaluation, and a Streamlit app for live prediction.

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

- **Model:** Multinomial Naive Bayes (trained with TF-IDF features)  
- **Interface:** Streamlit app (`app.py`) for interactive predictions  
- **Notebook:** `notebook/Spam_prediction.ipynb` contains preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving model/vectorizer  
- **Goal:** Build a reproducible pipeline that is easy to run and demonstrate
