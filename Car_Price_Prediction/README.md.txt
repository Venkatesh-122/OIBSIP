Got it 👍 I’ll adapt your **Iris README template** to match your **Car Price Prediction** project.
Here’s the **ready-to-use README.md**:

# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Summary
This project is a **Machine Learning regression model** that predicts **used car prices** based on various features such as brand, year, fuel type, mileage, and more.  
The best-performing model (**Stacking Regressor**) achieved an **R² score of ~0.80**, demonstrating strong predictive capability.  
The project also includes a **Streamlit web application** for deployment and public sharing via **ngrok**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Car dataset (contains multiple brands, years, mileage, etc.)  
- **Size**: ~X rows, Y features (after cleaning & preprocessing)  
- **Features**: Brand, Year, Mileage, Fuel Type, Transmission, Engine Power, etc.  
- **Target**: `Price` (Car price in USD or INR)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (ML Models & Evaluation)  
- XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM (Boosting models)  
- Streamlit (Web UI)  
- ngrok (Deployment & Sharing)

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, encoding categorical variables, outlier removal  
- Visualizations: distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, feature importance  
- Model training: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Stacking  
- Model evaluation: R² score, RMSE, MAE  
- Streamlit-based UI for easy predictions  
- Deployment with **ngrok** for public sharing

## 🚦 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** → Handle missing values, outliers, categorical encoding  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Visualize distributions & relationships  
3. **Feature Engineering** → Create meaningful features (e.g., car age)  
4. **Model Training** → Train multiple models (XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.)  
5. **Stacking Ensemble** → Combine models for higher accuracy  
6. **Evaluation** → Compare models using R², RMSE, MAE  
7. **Deployment** → Streamlit app deployed with ngrok

## ✅ Results
- Best Model: **Stacking Regressor (XGBoost + CatBoost + LightGBM)**  
- **R² Score**: ~0.80 on test data  
- **RMSE**: ~2.63  
- **MAE**: ~1.05  
- Achieved robust performance in predicting car prices across multiple brands and conditions
