# 📊 OASIS INFOBYTE Internship – Data Science Projects

This repository contains the projects I developed during my **Data Science Internship** at **Oasis Infobyte (OIBSIP)**.  
Each project demonstrates different machine learning concepts, from classification to regression and deployment.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 📧 Spam Detection
- **Goal**: Classify SMS/email messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
- **Techniques**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit app for real-time predictions.  
- **Key Files**:  
  - `Spam_prediction.ipynb` → Training & evaluation notebook  
  - `app.py` → Streamlit app  
  - `spam_classifier_nb.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl` → Saved model & vectorizer  
  - `spam.csv` → Dataset

### 2. 🚗 Car Price Prediction
- **Goal**: Predict car resale prices based on features (age, mileage, brand, etc.).  
- **Techniques**: Regression models, data preprocessing, feature engineering.  
- **Key Files**:  
  - `car_prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with analysis & training  
  - Model artifacts (`.joblib`, `.json`)

### 3. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
- **Goal**: Classify iris flowers into species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) using ML models.  
- **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
- **Key Files**:  
  - `iris_flower.ipynb` → Notebook with training & evaluation

## ⚙️ How to Run

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venkatesh-122/OIBSIP.git
cd OIBSIP
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Streamlit app (for Spam Detection):

```bash
cd Spam_Detection
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Results (Highlights)

* **Spam Detection** → Achieved **95–97% accuracy** with Naive Bayes.
* **Car Price Prediction** → Regression models successfully predicted resale prices.
* **Iris Classification** → High accuracy across classifiers (>95%).
